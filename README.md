Hello!

I'm Vitadek, I was born and raised in Tampa, Fl. 
I joined the Army right after high school as a signalier, working on routers and switches. 
I'd like to be a Cyber Security professional working as either a Information Security Officer, or an Incident Reaction Team

On my profile, I'll post a lot of my bash programs, as I currently like to play a lot on Linux. Possibly some other code too, as I'm going to college for CyberSecurity
and it includes a few coding classes.
