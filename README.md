Hello -

I'm Vitadek, I have a couple of side projects going on right now. Currently, I'm trying to build my personal brand with my domain: encryptedgardens.com. Here are the relative links below.
 
https://encryptedgardens.com -- This is the main website as well as my personal blog. There are some guides that you might be interested in. 
https://learn.encryptedgardens.com -- This is my work in progress learning platform for certifications that I've studied for or have obtained.
https://open.spotify.com/show/4KmlMb8oHBI7GyVVgHNO6y -- This is my encryptedgardens podcast. It's used for explaining hard to understand Information Security Topics.
